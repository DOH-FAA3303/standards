This is a static website documenting the proposed standards for public Github use at the Pacific Northwest Genomic Center of Excellence. There are documents on 

1.    Security and how to protect credential and private process leaks
2.    Licensing to protect re-sale or theft of code
3.    Github Organization templates and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
4.    Managing credentials
5.    Publishing code to the public repositories


If there are any questions please reach out to 

:::{.column-screen-inset-shaded layout-nrow="1"}

Protect Security and Credentials with good coding practices and our safety guidelines

Use our policy templates in github 

```{r}
# some code here

  df <- airquality |>
    stats::filter(Month==5)
)
```
