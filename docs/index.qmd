This is a website documenting the DIQA Sequencing Team's workflows. It is
written in **Markdown** and uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to allow
for `R`, `Python`, `SQL`, `Javascript` and code from other programming languages to be
displayed and executed. 

This website is divided by project, each in a separate tab in the
navigation bar above. Use the Home tab for onboarding and general help
